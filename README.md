- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel (muzykad397)
- ğŸ‘€ I am interested in the natural and social sciences. I have a background in Biostatistics but Environmental sciences and Agriculture can also pique my interest.
- âœ¨ I am currently on a self directed sabbatical. I am using my seasons passes and taking the opportunity to learn new coding skills outside of SAS and SQL.
- ğŸŒ± I am currently re-learning R after a few years away. Next on my list is a little Python.
